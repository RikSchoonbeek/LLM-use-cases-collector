# LLM-use-cases-collector
Gathering LLM use cases for personal use.

Using this application I want to get an idea of the LLM use cases being discussed on reddit.

For now my goal is personal use, but if I find that the use cases being discussed are valuable in practice I may want to think about sharing them somehow, in the future.
